Collection of 640x480px Themes for [SimpleMenu](https://github.com/fgl82/simplemenu)
---
> Ideal for RG350M and RG280M devices

As the image sources were not available in higher resolution (default system logos being the only exception), most of the images in the repository upscaled.  The themes were kept as consistent with their original form/design as possible.

## Default

Based on the default theme created by [FGL82](https://github.com/fgl82) and included in SimpleMenu 6.1.  Backgrounds and system images have been upscaled 2x using an AI-based smart-upscaler. System logos have been recreated entirely using the original source SVG files fpr optimal clarity.


## GBZ35 Remix theme

Based on the GBZ35 Remix theme created by [Weston Campbell](https://github.com/westoncampbell/sm-theme-gbz35-remix) and included in SimpleMenu 6.1. Backgrounds, system logos, and system images have all been upscaled 2x using an AI-based smart-upscaler.



## Assets
Default theme sources logos from system svg logos within RxBrad's [Gameboy Zero 3.5" Theme for EmulationStation](https://github.com/rxbrad/es-theme-gbz35) EmulationStation theme and other sources.

GBZ35 Remix was inspired by RxBrad's [Gameboy Zero 3.5" Theme for EmulationStation](https://github.com/rxbrad/es-theme-gbz35), and created for the [SimpleMenu](https://github.com/fgl82/simplemenu) front-end on the RG350. Also used assets from the [NBBA theme for EmulationStation](https://github.com/RetroPie/es-theme-nbba), and various other sources.

GBZ35 Remix is optimized for the RG350 with resolutions up to 320x240.
